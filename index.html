                <h1>Bensoul</h1>
                <p style=" color: slategrey;">Benson Mutua Muia, famously known as Bensoul, is the face of Sol Generation having been the first artiste to be signed on to the Sauti Sol-owned record label.
                 Sauti Sol started coming to my gigs and we became friends. They would have me over for their sessions and we began writing songs for different projects.
                 They called artistes over for a sort of jam session but they were actually shortlisting guys and they said they wanted to work with me.</p>

        <h1>Nviiri</h1>
       <p>Nviiri the Storyteller real name is Nviiri Sande. He is a Kenyan songwriter, video editor, guitarist and a performing singer. He is among the artists who are signed under the Sol Generation. Nviiri was second to be signed under Sol Generation.
       he decided to pursue his first love, music, a decision that seems to be paying off very well. While most of his writing gigs started a pass time, his collaboration with the successful Sauti Sol band opened doors for him. Nviiri is a beautiful singe on his own. However, his collaborations with one of Kenya's most successful bands catapulted his success in ways he could not imagine.</p>

       <h1>Okello Max</h1>
       <p>Julius Okello McRymboh – but commonly known as Okello Max,  is a man who wears many hats. He is a music lover, singer, songwriter, a communication graduate but above all, he identifies himself as a joker who enjoys making people laugh.
    Sol Generation has morphed into a family I never knew I needed and the least I can say is that it’s been an honour to be able to learn and continue to do so under their guidance.</p>
